## Description

This was my first attempt at creating a portfolio website from the ground up. I wanted to understand how to use html and css more effiecently. This project is to show off my work to possible future employers. During this project I learned how to create a website. I had very little knowledge before I started. I learned how to use flex-wrap, media queries, and create every aspect of a website including sections, fonts, backgrounds, and more.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```
